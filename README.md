From this we can see that Asheville market is dominated by Entire home/Apartment rental type across different level of price, which takes more than 80% of listing. Entire home/Apartment room type is suitable for a group of mid to large size travellers, meaning that Asheville market is attracting a group of travellers instead of a couple or individuals. Therefore, I would recommend Entire home/Apartment hosts should add some more utilities, such as private parking space or outdoor space, which could attract more families with kids.
